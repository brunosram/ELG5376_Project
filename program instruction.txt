To run a full testing iteration of this program: 
Run :
1 Watermarking\testEncode.m(be sure to put the water mark image in the same folder with this .m file)
2 Watermarking\testbeta.m(put the audio files in the same folder with this file)
3 Attack\attack2.m
4 Extraction\testattack2.m
5 Extraction\testDecode.m

To test the capacity: modify the amount of data in the testeEncode.m, then uses SNR\testSNR.m to get the result.
To test the SNR: uses SNR\testSNR.m to get the result.
To test the robustness: uses Attack\attack2.m. This script will generate a number of different signal sample after different kinds attack. Change the "wav=wav_final_double;" in Attack\attack2.m to change the extracted signal.
If mp3 compression is need to be tested, please use lame in command line to compress the signal before running attack2.m. 
The code used to generate the watermark image is quoted in the end of Extraction\testDecode.m, when in Watermarking\testEncode.m the data read from picture is used, a extracted watermark can be generated.
